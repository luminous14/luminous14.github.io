          Each alternates between the role of Driver and Navigator.</p>
        <h3>Why is pair-programming important to DBC?</h3>
        <p>Pair programming is important to DBC to ensure that boots develop the skills they need to work
          on projects in the real world. Pairing has also demonstrated better outcomes than individual effort.

        <h3>Compare driver and navigator</h3>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This was my third time pairing on a challenge, and my first guided pairing session with a DBC instructor. Overall I enjoyed it. It's great working with other human beings! I like spending time working things out for myself, but I love collaborating with a team. I have this perception that pairing is slower than when I work on my own, however when I do pair I find I usually gain additional insights from my partner. For this pairing, I learned a little bit better how to keep the structure of my CSS and HTML files organized. In addition, the concepts of padding, margin, and border are beginning to become more clear. Because pairing remotely is new to me, it seems like a lot of time is spent just working out the technicalities. Researching also seems more difficult for me, because in pairing I feel pressure to read faster than I normally would, and don't feel like I can experiment and play around like I'm used to due to the restrictions of the navigator / driver relationship.
