  <div class="reflection">
    Learning about responsive design was fascinating for me. I've used devices of various resolutions in the past, and notice the layout difference between devices. Seeing how CSS can control the way the page displays based on max-width was a lot of fun. At first I was a little confused by the terminology of Liquid, Adaptive, Responsive, and Static, but after seeing <a href="http://liquidapsive.com/">liquidapsive.com</a> it became more clear. I had a lot of fun responsifying the kitten website for this challenge. I had a hard time working through the positioning of elements, but after some trial, error, and research it seems to have come together. The way the nav bar is lined up with the content below still troubles me. It seems there should be a better way to anchor the nav bar to the image. Also, when I resize my window in Firefox, the nav bar links pop positions frequently, however on Chrome there is no popping. Why is that?
