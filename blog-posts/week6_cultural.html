            <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>

            <strong>stereotype threat:</strong>
            <blockquote><em>"a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group."</em></blockquote>

            The big stereotype threat I recall feeling was in the eighth grade. Previously, all of my schooling took place at one school. I had left familiar surroundings and friends. My new school was a private christian school. Shortly into the school year, while trying to make new friends at that awkward age, I mentioned to some boys at the lunch table that I was related to someone in our history book who was a pioneer of the Mormon Trail in the 1840's. Immediately my comment illicted laughter. One boy incredulously said "You're related to a mormon?" To which I replied, "Yes. I'm a mormon too." Another incredulous response: "If you're a mormon, why are you at this school?" Another boy said "My dad told me that all mormons go to hell, and that they wear funny underwear." I think I stopped talking at that point, the rest is a blur. What I remember is how awful and unsafe I felt. Basically, these classmates were telling me that I didn't belong there even though I too was a christian, apparently that wasn't enough
            <br></br>
            I've had the identity of being a mormon most of my life. Friends in my previous school and in my neighborhood were aware of it. It was never a point of concern for me. It was just a normal part of my life. For the rest of the school year I made every effort to keep my identity a secret. I remember being constantly concerned that someone else would find out and that I would be judged for it by teachers and by students.
            <br></br>
            All students were required to take a religion class. Mine was an old testament class taught from a different perspective than I was used to. I felt threatened particularly in this class. Not because I had a problem with what was being taught, but I felt threatened that I would be treated differently or unfairly because of my mormon identity. Ocassionally, the teacher would contrast what he was teaching to catholic beliefs. There were a few catholic students in my class who during these moments would always question him or raise objections. The teacher never made any effort to engage them in healthy conversation, but just moved along as if their comments were not valid or worthwhile.
            <br></br>
            Eighth grade was hell for me. My grades were quite awful and I missed a lot of school. It might have been the worst year of my life. So, I insisted that my parents let me go to a different school the next year. My next school was different, and things weren't quite so rocky in the stereotype threat department. I still felt a need to conceal my identity, but during the first week of school we did a "get to know your classmates" type of activity in English class. I was teamed up with an intelligent and bubbly girl who asked me several basic questions including an innocent "what religion are you?" I hesitantly told her, and she immediately brightened up and said "Oh, now that's interesting!" At the time I didn't quite know how to interpret her comment, but looking back I see it as genuine interest and non-threatening. The remainder of the exercise was to stand up and tell the rest of the class about who we had interviewed. So much for secrets - the whole class knew. But it wasn't a bad thing. Over the course of the next four years I made new friends who occasionally teased me about it, but I didn't experience the constant anxiety from it that I had in eighth grade. I felt no judgement of my worth or potential because of it.
            <br></br>
            Perhaps its because of this experience that I try hard not to be judgemental of others. I'm particularly sensitive to not wanting others to think of me as being judgemental, whether because of race, politics, religion, sexual orientation, age, economic status, etc.
            <br></br>
            So, what will I do if I feel stereotype threat at DBC? I don't know... I think I tend to be more concerned about others not feeling threatened. In that regard I like what Claude Steele said in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk&t=51m19s">video</a> about how white professors giving feedback to black students was best receieved. I think this concept could apply in a lot of situations. To give genuine attention to the work and efforts of others and give them encouragement as part of that feedback. Tell others that you've looked at their work and that you believe they can make something great if they keep working at it, and don't make him or her feel that their identity dicates their worth or potential for success.
