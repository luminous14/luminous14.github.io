            <h2>Chefs in the Kitchen</h2>
              <p>I just watched Shereef Bishay's <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Fireside Chat.</a> Much of what he spoke about resonated with me. Everything he touched on made sense, and a few things made me a tiny bit nervous.</p>

              <p>Shereef compares our mindset about DevBootcamp to a restaurant. The first mindset is that of a guest sitting at the table. They expect to order what they want off the menu, receive outstanding service, pay the bill, and walk away satisfied with a meal that has been handed to them on a platter. The second mindset is that of the chef in the kitchen, rolling up his or her sleeves in the trenches, engaged in making the best meal possible with their team. Each of us slips into both mindsets at times, but to be successful at DevBootcamp, no one can linger too long in the table mindset. I can't expect to pay tuition, show up, and simply place my order and expect to be handed programming knowledge on a platter. I have to work for it. I have to be the chef who goes into the kitchen and makes the meal happen. Even in phase 0, I found myself halfway through grumbling about how much more time these exercises have taken, and wondering why I wasn't told how much longer it would really take. I'm past that now. I've enjoyed the time spent, even if I've had a couple of long days. Next week I'll make sure if I want to take it easy, it's at the end of the week and not the beginning.</p>

              <p>Along with these two mindsets, Shereef mentioned two fears that he sees students come into the program with. The first is fear of being an imposter, or not being smart enough. "Perhaps it was a mistake that I was accepted to begin with." The second is fear of being trapped with mediocre people. If anything, if I did have a fear it would be of being an imposter, although I don't feel that fear right now. When I was first hired at Rhythm & Hues Studios, I thought I was in way over my head. I had so much to learn about Linux, navigating the terminal, how the VFX pipeline worked, etc. As I kept at it, I realized that my manager saw something in me when he hired me that I didn't realize was there. I had the ability to pick things up quickly, get the job done, and look for ways to do the job better next time. Even though I knew nothing coming in, I had the ability to get along with my co-workers and the ability to learn.</p>

              <p>I know coming into DevBootcamp that the purpose is to build thoughtful engineers, and not just brick layers. However, that part of the program does make me a little nervous. To me, learning the languages feels safe, but learning the principles of good design can be scary. I'm not afraid to work at good design and engineering, but it might take me some time to feel confident in my abilities as a competent designer.</p>

              <p>This video is yet another inspiration for me. I am excited to be working on phase 0, and I look forward to joining my cohort and the instructors in Chicago. My expectations of DBC haven't really changed, but the expectations I have for myself have been kicked up another notch.</p>

              <p>I attended the <a href="http://www.tft.ucla.edu/programs/film-tv-digital-media-department/graduate-degrees/animation-mfa/">UCLA Animation Workshop</a> for my Masters degree, which at the end of each year was a bit like a boot camp. We were taught basic animation principles and given resources for self-learning. In the end we learned the most by always pushing ourselves, collaborating with other students, and giving of ourselves. I thrived in that environment and have no doubt that I will thrive at DevBootcamp. I love the way Shereef said that we should walk in hungry, and mad, and inspired, and ready to give, and that we will learn a ton through offering of ourselves to others.</p>
