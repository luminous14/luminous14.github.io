        <h3>Comparing Websites</h3>
        <p>For my first blog post I'll be comparing three of my favorites websites: Amazon, Pandora, and Fitday.</p>

        <p><strong>First up - <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a></strong></p>

        I'm not much of a shopper. Neither is my wife. I like to say we're "thrifty" and I'm sometimes tempted to become a hardcore minimalist... but whoa mama, I love buying stuff (occasionally) on Amazon.com! Primarily, I love that I can find used items online for less money than what I'd normally pay for new items in the store. The large number of user reviews and ratings on Amazon are a real gold mine as well. Without user reviews I'd have a much harder time figuring out what to buy.</p>

        <p>A bonus to Amazon is that it has a simple, clean design that's easy to navigate. The home page has ads and deals as the main feature, which is all right, but my eye quickly scans past that and up to the search field, which is where I really want to go. Amazon makes it so easy to find what I'm looking for; I can't help but buy stuff through them. They don't always have the best prices on items compared to other sites, but the ease of use and shear volume of items they sell win me over almost every time.</p>

        <p>Amazon's content and design is successful because they give the user what they want: lots of features, but simple design and navigation. It lets you go where you want to go, and gives you the information you want to know. Aside from shopping, however, if I have a question about my account, often times I do a Google search rather than search on browsing Amazon's website.</p>

        <p><strong>Next up is <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora.com</a></strong></p>

        <p>Like most human beings, music stirs my soul. I first learned about Pandora back in 2008 while starting a new job as a render wrangler working graveyard shift. I did a Google search for "internet radio" and Pandora popped up. At first I was confused by what it claimed it would do for my listening experience, but it didn't take long for its grandeur to be revealed and I was hooked. For anyone not familiar with Pandora, it lets you create multiple music stations based on a genre, artist, or album. It will find songs that are a match to your criteria, and also play related artists and styles. Much of my favorite music today was introduced to me through Pandora.</p>

        <p>Pandora also has a simple and easy to navigate layout. The first two things that stand out when I login are the album cover of the current song and the play controls right above it. To me these are the most important parts of the site, and kudos to them for making them the most important visually. Now, there is one "pesky" thing about Pandora and that's the ads! I know I can pay to get rid of the ads, but since I'm "thrifty" I'm willing to listen to their advertising. It doesn't really bother me anyway since the ads are brief and not too frequent. I've never actually purchased music through Pandora, so they need to get their money's worth out me somehow. Usually I only listen to music when I'm working at my desk, and I enjoy listening to variety more than a predetermined library of songs anyway, so it's never made sense to buy it.</p>

        <p>Another awesome thing about Pandora is that I can read more about the artist I'm listening to right on the site, and also find other albums they've created. Once I'm done reading I can easily find way my back to the song that is "Now Playing" by using the navigation bar at the top of the content window. I always walk away from Pandora feeling edified or motivated by the music I've listened to. Truly a remarkable site - life changing in some ways.</p>

        <p><strong>Lastly, there's <a href="http://www.fitday.com">Fitday.com</a></strong></p>

        <p>I discovered Fitday around the same time I discovered Pandora. After getting married I put on a few pounds and it occurred to me there might be a web app that could help me count calories. I've never been a fan of diets, so I was looking for something that didn't seem gimmicky. I tried out several sites, but Fitday won out over the rest of them for several reasons. Fitday's tools were easier for me to access, it allowed me to enter all of my food in grams (unlike any other site I tried), and it had lots of easy to understand reports and graphs. At first, I tracked just about everything. I tracked all of my physical activities and calories so I could see how many calories I was burning, and predict how much weight I would lose in a give week. I must say it worked remarkably well. I lost 65Lbs and felt great. Six years later I still use the site, but with varied success.</p>

        <p>Now I must note, my comments on Fitday are based on Fitday Classic. A couple of years ago, there was a redesign of Fitday, called Fitday 2. I try using 2.0 every so often, but always revert to Classic. My main beef with Fitday 2 is that in spite of the cleaner, newer look, it takes me more time to enter my calorie information. In this case, speed and ease of use win out over design. Fitday Classic lets me see a list of all of my entered foods from the past couple of weeks, and check a box next to all of the foods I'll be eating for the current day. After these are checked I hit a button that lets me add all of them to my current day's food log. It all loads up in one shot! Why can't I do that in Fitday 2!? Fitday 2 makes me add any recent food item one at a time, and I have to wait for each item to load. Tedious!</p>

        <p>Back to the layout of Fitday Classic: when I first log in, the first thing I see is my food log. Perfect. If I want to review any of my goals or reports, they're all listed at the top in the navigation bar. My only complaint about the navigation bar is that there are too many tabs. Some of them are named too similarly and others seem ill placed. These problems have been fixed in Fitday 2, however since I use the food log more than anything else, I'm content living with the inferior navigation of Fitday Classic.</p>

        <p>Like Pandora, since Fitday is free they have advertising. They also sell a PC version of the app, but reviews that I've read indicate there's nothing in the PC version worth bothering with that's not already in the online app. I can't stand the ads on Fitday. Half of the time it's bad cartoon drawings of fat bellies and thighs. Who wants to see that? Really guys? It annoyed me so much I run ad-block software on the site now.</p>

        <p>I have a love-hate relationship with the site, beyond the ads and the Classic vs. Fitday 2 issue. When I'm making progress on my fitness and nutrition goals, I love it. When I'm falling short, the site just depresses me and I want to kick it to the curb. I keep coming back though - right now I love it since my fitness goals are on track. It really is a nice tool for losing weight. If you ask me again at Christmas time you might find it has fallen off of my top-three list.</p>

        <p>In the end, I'm a believer in eating right and exercising regularly, and believe that you need to be very aware of what you're using to fuel your body. Calorie counting is a simple way to help train your habits.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, websites are all at the top of my list primarily because of what they let me do. Shop for cool stuff easily and affordably, listen to my favorite and find new favorites, and keep my fitness goals on track. Usability and design heightens this experience. The site needs to be simple and easy to understand, and powerful enough to keep me engaged.</p>
