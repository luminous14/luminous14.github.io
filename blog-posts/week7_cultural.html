        <h3>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h3>

        <h4>Exploring my Values</h4>
        When I think of the times in my life when I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the following values come to mind:
<br></br>
        Accomplishment Affection Challenge Close relationships Commitment Compassion Competence Confidence Cooperation Courage Creativity Credibility Economic security Fairness Faith Free time Freedom Friendships Growth Having a family Health Helping other people Honesty Inner harmony Insight Inspiration Integrity Knowledge Meaningful work Nature Order Peace Personal development Physical challenge Purity Quality Self-reliance Self-respect Spirituality Stability Truth Will-power Wisdom.
<br></br>
        Having a family is on my list because It's at the center of what I choose to do with my life. Much of my happiness is tied into my wife, kids, and other family members. Their happiness is my happiness, so I try to serve them and grow closer to them.
        I also consider Personal development to be a key to my happiness. I've never felt satisfied with "business as usual" for very long. If I'm not learning something new, getting better at breaking bad habits and forming good ones, etc., then I start to feel anxious or down.
<br></br>
        On a scale of 1-5, do I generally try to live up to these values?
        <br></br>
        <span style="color:green">Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</span>
        <br></br>
        I would say 5, even though I certainly fall short in someway every day.
<br></br>
        <h4>Advice</h4>
        The last topic someone asked me for advice on was about Meaningful work. She has been thinking about quitting her job in order to have time to figure out what she'd rather be doing. Perhaps she recognized that I value doing work that is meaningful, even in my present situation of trying to find lasting employment. I'm sure she believed I might have some advice that would help her, although since her scenario is still in progress we have yet to see.
<br></br>
        <h4>Values and Stereotype Threat</h4>
        When I think about my values, it brings to mind different challenges I've overcome and other positive experiences. I suppose reflecting on these values would help mediate stereotype threat if I recognize I feel it. Other exercises that I would turn to would be meditation/prayer, to find peace and move beyond the feelings.
