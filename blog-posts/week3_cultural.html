            <h2>My Thinking and Learning Style</h2>
            <img id="imgLeadPost" src="imgs/strongBrain.png">

            <p>Dev Bootcamp Phase 0 week 3 is almost over now. In this post I'll be reflecting on my learning preferences and how I might be most effective throughout my time with DBC.</p>
            <p>Before starting Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp, I took a <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> test and scored these restults:</p>
            <p>Concrete Sequential:<strong> 48</strong></p>
            <p>Abstract Sequential:<strong> 20</strong></p>
            <p>Abstract Random:<strong> 32</strong></p>
            <p>Concrete Random:<strong> 20</strong></p>
            <p>Having read through the descriptions of these learning styles, it sort of feels like I'm reading a horoscope. I can identify with each of these learning styles. Of course, this is because none of us fits into a box, and we all have various preferences depending on the situation. I find it amusing that the areas I scored the highest in seem to be opposite in some respects, for example:</p>
            <p><strong>Concrete Sequential:</strong> Needs and enjoys structured situations. Likes things to be ordered and arranged in specific ways.</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract Random:</strong> Dislikes routine procedures and orderliness.</p>
            <p>Concrete Sequential learning style does reflect my experiences and feelings most accurately though. I usually feel uncomfortable trying to learn when my environment is very unorganized. Often I need to clean my desk before I can get in the zone to work. As a toddler, my pre-school teacher observed my need for order. She told my mother that I was "a child who needs to have things in order." When my mother told me about this comment, in my adult years, I found it surprising because I never considered myself to be particularly orderly. However, since then I've recognized that I feel most at ease when my world seems in order. This includes more than just my desk - It includes my health, my relationships, the task at hand, etc. If something is bothering me in my personal life, I feel distracted until I can put those issues in order. Before executing a task, I try to have a plan ahead of time, or an outline to follow. Otherwise I feel lost in my purpose. I even outlined this blog post before attempting to flesh it out.</p>
            <p>While working at home, I'm able to keep the door shut and be in my own little world on my own terms. Mostly. My two little kids sometimes come in and interrupt, or at times I have to step out of my office and help with something. Everyday is a little bit different. For the most part though, I have solid chunks of time without interruption in which to do my work.</p>
            <p>As a Concrete Sequential learner, I also prefer to have exact and ordered examples presented to me in order to learn. Sometimes I have a hard time imagining something, or grasping instructions or explanations that are being given to me verbally. When someone shows me an example, provides steps to implement it, and then I get to use it myself, I internalize it much more easily. In this regard, I feel like I need to reach out more to Instructors and make use of office hours when I'm having a hard time grasping a concept.</p>
            <p>My biggest struggle so far during Phase 0 has been trying to work with a pair when researching a subject I'm not familiar with. I've had a couple of pairing sessions where I had already completed the challenge. In those cases, I enjoyed pairing in that I could observe the learning process of my pair, in turn learning from their learning. It helped solidify the concepts I had already  gone over. On the flip side, during the times I've paired for a challenge I was unfamiliar with I felt disorganized and felt a loss of control. In some ways this seem to impede my learning. In spite of this, I recognize value in pairing. Making a human connection with others is important to me, so I don't totally mind the fact that I feel disorganized since I know I can always review the material on my own later. I'm not sure how best to address this, however. In recent pairing sessions, I've let my pair know when I need some silent time to think and reflect. This helps somewhat, but I always feel pressure from myself to hurry up with what I'm trying to research and thus have a harder time internalizing things. I also feel like I want to take time to experiment on my own during the session, but am unable to because of the navigator / driver roles. Because of my struggle to pair when I'm not familiar with a challenge, my plan is to only pair when I've completed the challenge already, unless the challenge instructions dictate otherwise.</p>
            <p>Prior to Phase 0, I read <a href="http://mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/">Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</a>. What a great book. The author shares over 20 years of experience researching her theory of growth vs. fixed mindsets. Basically, a fixed mindset is one where we tell ourselves that we or others can't change. A growth mindset is where we believe we can change, that others can change, and that we can find and implement ways to overcome obstacles. I believe that I generally have a growth mindset about most things. I have a fixed mindset regarding my ability to learn how to dance, but most other things I'm optimistic about. I recognize that learning style doesn't have to be fixed. Going into Dev Bootcamp, I'm willing to try new things and trust the process. The fact that I'm blogging about this right now is evidence of that :)</p>
