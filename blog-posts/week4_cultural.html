            <h2>Privacy and Technology</h2>
            <img id="imgLeadPost" src="imgs/privacy.jpg">

            <p>Companies like to gather information about people. It makes sense to me why that is. Companies want to use their resources most effectively when marketting to customers. They don't want to waste time trying to sell baby products to people that don't have babies, sell beef jerkey to vegetarians, and sell kilts to people with no affinity for Irish or Scottish culture. Being able to sell products to people that genuinely want them is part of how our society works.</p>

            <p>Governments like to gather information about their citizens. It makes sense to me why that is. Governments want to have statistical data to use towards policy decisions. Governments also want to track down criminals as efficiently as possible. The more concerning part of this is how far can the government go, and who is keeping and eye on them? There needs to be a way to hold the government accountable for the information they gather and how they use it. Otherwise, great injustices will arrise.</p>


            <p>Companies like Facebook and Google have collected vast ammounts of information about millions of individuals, and the government has tapped into these companies for private information in order to track down persons of interest. Facebook and Google have also used people's preferrences and photos in order to market products and services. What does this mean to you and me? Should it be allowed? What should we be doing about it? Do you care?</p>

            <p>People in general like to share things about themselves publicly. They also like to keep some things private. I believe people's privacy should be respected. How that can be possible in our current world is beyond me, however. The best advice I can offer and put into practice myself, is if I don't want anyone else to know about something I said, something I believe, pictures I've taken, etc., then don't post it online. If you don't want people to know what your interests are, don't do a search on Google. I think there should be regulations on how data is collected and distributed, and that needs to be worked out by politicians and the voters who elect them. In the mean time though, I think people need to be aware of how their private information can and is being used, and to be careful of what they share.</p>
