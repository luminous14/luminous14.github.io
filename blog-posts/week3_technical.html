            <h2>Why is JavaScript so Popular?</h2>

            <img id="imgLeadPost" src="imgs/JavaScriptLogo.png">

            <p>After doing a little reading on JavaScript, I get the impression that many people have a love / hate relationship with this scripting language. Since I'm new to web development, I'm just beginning to understand concepts within the language, and how and why it's used. That being said, I don't expect to be able to explain anything revolutionary to someone who's been working with JavaScript longer than I have. This post is directed at people who have never written a line of code.</p>

            <p>So, what does JavaScript allow us to do? Well, it lets programmers develop apps for mobile devices, apps on your browser, and apps that are used internally within companies. JavaScript allows us to interface with these apps. Ever had to enter your personal information on a webpage? Well, then you've interacted with JavaScript.</p>

            <p>There are many programming languages and scripting languages in the world today, but JavaScript is by far the most widely used. Why is that? Well, part of it is that it was originally created to make web pages do more than just provide information. In the earlier days of web browsing, web pages were static; you couldn't interact with them. Do you remember Netscape Navigator? JavaScript originated with this now unsupported web browser. With the introduction of JavaScript came the ability for people to interact with websites.</p>

            <p>What has kept JavaScript alive over the years? JavaScript is easy to learn compared to other languages, it's flexible, and it can be used and is supported by the most common web browsers. JavaScript is also easy for programmers to edit. Most browsers allow you to actually peek under the hood and see the JavaScript that is being run in the background. Many tools are available for programmers to edit the code, right in their browser. This ability to edit in the browser also makes it easier for programmers to look for errors and problems in their code. JavaScript is also a flexible language, which means it can be more easily and quickly implemented.</p>

            <p>Especially interesting to me during my reading was to find that HTML5 and use of JavaScript seem to be replacing flash on the web. Flash is very heavy to load, but HTML5 and JavaScript are much more sleek and faster loading. Also, to develop in JavaScript and HTML5 there is no cost, unlike flash software sold by Adobe.</p>

            <p>Though JavaScript started out for web browsers on PCs, these days it is being used on mobile devices more and more. Also, JavaScript is being adopted by companies for internal app development. This means that the apps a company uses for its own internal communications and interfaces are being written in JavaScript.

            <p>Even though JavaScript is perhaps the most popular language today, it does have its flaws. Over the years it has been influenced by many who have chimed in on how it should work and what it should do. This has left it with some quirks that oftentimes frustrate programmers, such as having unexpected results from their code. Part of what makes JavaScript so flexible also makes it harder to rein in at times. In spite of its ugly parts, it's clear to me that JavaScript is going to be around for a while, and in my career as a web developer, I will have to embrace it.</p>
