            <h2>Dealing with Conflict</h2>
            <img  id="imgLeadPost" src="imgs/shame.jpg">
            <p>Several years ago I had a strained working relationship with one of my coworkers. Numerous times over the course of 3 to 6 months this co-worker sent me rude emails. Sometimes they were criticism of my work efforts and sometimes they were bossy demands. These emails made my blood boil, but I always responded politely. Whenever we were in meetings together, she never looked me in the eye and had a strange behavior about her that also clued me in that she had a problem with me.</p>

            <p>There were certain aspects of my job that I felt a little under-qualified for, though I was trying my best to make the grade. I had a bit of a case of impostor syndrome, I must admit. My sense is that my coworker recognized where I wasn't as strong as she was in these areas, but rather than being positive in her criticism, it was as if she had written me off when I was just getting started. For the most part, I just tried to avoid dealing with this coworker as much as possible.</p>

            <p>One week there was a delicate situation we were all working on, and she sent me another rude email regarding actions I had taken that were exact instructions I had received from my boss. I brought it to the attention of my boss, and also showed her some other emails I had previously received. I was told that they were inappropriate, and that my coworker would be talked to. Things seemed to go a little better, but not much.</p>

            <p>After a few weeks, I got a call from my coworker after I had gone home from work. She apologized to me for how she had been behaving and explained that she had been judgmental of me because she perceived me as being lazy. Often she would ask me to do things which I couldn't get to, because my boss had given me a ton of other higher priority tasks to work on. She had a conversation with the V.P. of the company where she complained about me. The V.P. explained to her what sort of work load and pressures I had been under for several months. Somehow this got lost in our prior dealings with each other, and in hindsight I would have explained to her what my workload was like, which she apparently had no clue about. She had no idea what kind of over time I was putting in every week, and had no idea of the numerous side projects I was on. I think she was so upset with her perceptions of me because her family had a stake in the company and she was feeling a lot of pressure to make the business a success.</p>

            <p>After this phone call we had zero problems with each other. At work we spoke kindly to each other and for the first time worked as a team. I was amazed at how much better my work life was as a result.</p>

            <p>I've had a couple of work experiences slightly similar to this one, but none as extreme. In each case it was a situation where I felt that a coworker saw me as an impostor. Rather than addressing this head on, I tend to try my best to prove to the other person that I'm not an impostor over the course of time and through my work efforts. Something that I might have tried, and think would be a good strategy in the future, is to acknowledge my need for growth and ask that person for their help to make it happen, rather than just trying to avoid them.</p>
